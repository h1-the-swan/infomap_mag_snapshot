I've loaded the MAG data into a database and exported the PaperReferences into a TSV.
Now it's time to run Infomap.

remember to use the virtual environment:
`source venv/bin/activate`
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

+ Convert the TSV to a pajek (.net) file
+ Try to run Infomap
+ If the network is too big, try RelaxMap
